Description


Features
Task Management: Organize your tasks into customizable categories and prioritize them based on importance.
Workflow Execution: Upload workflow data consisting of node types and connections, and MyApp's backend interprets the workflow to execute tasks in the defined sequence.
Filter Data Node: The "Filter Data" node processes uploaded data by converting column values to lowercase.
Wait Node: Introduces an asynchronous delay using server-side logic to synchronize task execution.
Convert Format Node: Transforms data from CSV to JSON format for compatibility and ease of use.
Send POST Request Node: Transmits the generated JSON payload to a predefined URL (a mock URL using https://requestcatcher.com/ can be used for testing).
